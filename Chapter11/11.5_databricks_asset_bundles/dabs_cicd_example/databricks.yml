targets:
  # The 'dev' target, used for development purposes.
  # Whenever a developer deploys using 'dev', they get their own copy.
  dev:
    # We use 'mode: development' to make sure everything deployed to this target gets a prefix
    # like '[dev my_user_name]'. Setting this mode also disables any schedules and
    # automatic triggers for jobs and enables the 'development' mode for Delta Live Tables pipelines.

  # Optionally, there could be a 'staging' target here.

  # The 'prod' target, used for production deployment.
  prod:
    # For production deployments, we only have a single copy, so we override the
    # workspace.root_path default of
    # /Users/${workspace.current_user.userName}/.bundle/${bundle.target}/${bundle.name}
    # to a path that is not specific to the current user.
